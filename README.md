### Preambule
Anyone can develop UI components in the context of an application, with benefits of integration to styles, services and backends but in isolated one on another environment. Here is the set of Web Components to wrap any developing UI components and pages in an environment where they could be designed and developed without interfering with each other. Just add the Stories packages and run the setup script to finalise the installation to get the working solution.
