# Stories
Stories is a set of **packages** that helps you visually test UI components and pages in an isolated environment in the context of the application. 

You can seamlessly integrate Stories with various cross-platform native and web app experiences. Here is a list of those tested so far:
- [Angular](/docs/angular/overview)
- [React](/docs/react/overview)
- [Vue](/docs/vue/overview)
<!--
- Aurelia
- Ember
- HTML
- Marionette
- Marko
- Meteor
- Mithril
- Preact
- React Native
- Rax
- Riot
- Svelte
- Surplus
- Web Components
  - Lit
  - Polymer
-->

Alternatively, it can be used standalone without any frontend framework using a simple script include.

Stories supports visual testing on both client and server-side rendering out of the box!
