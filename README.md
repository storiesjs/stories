### Preambule
We believe everyone can develop UI components in the context of application, with benifits of integration to styles but in isolated one on anothe environment. We develop the set of Web Components to wrap any developing UI components and pages in an environment where they could be design and develop without interfearing between them. To integrate the StoriesJS solution into any application the one need to add the packages and run setup script to finalise installation.
